Sticky Notes App using CakePHP
=========================


This is a basic "Sticky Note" application built with CakePHP Framework.

The App's authentication is built with the CakePHP's auth component. 

It includes all the CRUD functionalities. i.e Creating a sticky note, updation of it and deleteion of the same.

Features included:

1) Realtime saving of Notes and deletion of it.

2) Authentication for particular user.

I'll add more functions in next versions of App.
